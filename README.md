# AdventOfCode2024
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

The code in this repo is written in Python using Google Colab.
I used a combination of my own creativity, Colab's generate code feature and ChatGPT to write the code.
